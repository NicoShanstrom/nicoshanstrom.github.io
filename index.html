    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Nico, a fitness and health professional turned event coordinator, photographer, and now, software
      developer. I'm a lifelong learner, always keeping a 'beginner's mind' because there's something to learn from
      every experience.</p>
    <p>My professional journey began in 2010 as a sports performance specialist, helping athletes of all ages reach their best selves
      through speed, power, agility, and functional training. I extended my passion for athletic performance to all
      populations, working in fitness studios and running a personal training business in Miami.</p>
    <p>In 2012, I pursued a Master's in Athletic Training to deepen my skills in evaluation, therapeutics, and injury
      prevention. From 2014 to 2017, I worked as an Athletic Trainer at Westminster Christian School in Palmetto Bay,
      Florida, which was incredibly rewarding. It was fulfilling to impact future generations positively.</p>
    <p>In 2016, I traveled to Fiji for a transformative 45-day yoga teacher training. The experience taught me the value
      of simplicity and gratitude, changing my perspective on life. In 2017, I adventured to Colorado, where I worked in
      various athletic training roles at physical therapy clinics, corporations for employee ergonomic assessments and
      plans, extreme sports events, college sports events, Denver Nuggets NBA games, and even taught fitness classes and
      workshops at OrangeTheory Fitness.</p>
    <p>The pandemic in 2020 shifted my career again. My wife and I started an online yoga and fitness studio, helping
      people stay active during uncertain times. We then moved to Northern California and eventually to Maui, where I
      worked with Maui Luxe Picnics as an event coordinator and professional photographer, creating and capturing
      once-in-a-lifetime moments.</p>
    <p>The devastating fires on Maui in August 2023 were a turning point. With work scarce, I enrolled in the Turing
      School of Software Design, starting in October 2022 while still in Maui. Now, as I near the end of my software
      developer education, I see a new beginning. The challenges have made me stronger and more determined to make a
      positive impact.</p>
    <p>Today, I'm in Asheville, North Carolina, equipped with skills in Ruby, Rails, RESTful APIs, TDD, and more. Turing
      taught me how to learn and adapt, and I'm excited to use these skills to support my family and work on meaningful
      projects.</p>
    <p>If you've read this far, thank you! I hope you enjoyed my story.</p>

    <h2>My Work</h2>
    Here are some projects I am working on at the moment:
      An update to the 1000 hours application. My wife was using this to track outdoor time for our child because the average american child gets 4-7 minutes of unstructured outdoor time each day.
      I wanted to track statistics of total time, daily average, required average per day to reach 1000, on pace to achieve this many hours, and tracking sessions.
