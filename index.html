    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Nico, a fitness and health professional turned event coordinator, photographer, and now, software
      developer. I'm a lifelong learner, always keeping a 'beginner's mind' because there's something to learn from
      every experience.</p>
    <p>My professional journey began in 2010 as a sports performance specialist, helping athletes of all ages reach
      their best selves through speed, power, agility, and functional training. I extended my passion for athletic
      performance to all populations, working in fitness studios and running a personal training business in Miami.</p>
    <p>In 2012, I pursued a Master's in Athletic Training to deepen my skills in evaluation, therapeutics, and injury
      prevention. From 2014 to 2017, I worked as an Athletic Trainer at Westminster Christian School in Palmetto Bay,
      Florida, which was incredibly rewarding. It was fulfilling to impact future generations positively.</p>
    <p>In 2016, I traveled to Fiji for a transformative 45-day yoga teacher training. The experience taught me the value
      of simplicity and gratitude, changing my perspective on life. In 2017, I adventured to Colorado, where I worked in
      various athletic training roles at physical therapy clinics, corporations for employee ergonomic assessments and
      plans, extreme sports events, college sports events, Denver Nuggets NBA games, and even taught fitness classes and
      workshops at OrangeTheory Fitness.</p>
    <p>The pandemic in 2020 shifted my career again. My wife and I started an online yoga and fitness studio, helping
      people stay active during uncertain times. We then moved to Northern California and eventually to Maui, where I
      worked with Maui Luxe Picnics as an event coordinator and professional photographer, creating and capturing
      once-in-a-lifetime moments.</p>
    <p>The devastating fires on Maui in August 2023 were a turning point. With work scarce, I enrolled in the Turing
      School of Software Design, starting in October 2022 while still in Maui. Now, as I near the end of my software
      developer education, I see a new beginning. The challenges have made me stronger and more determined to make a
      positive impact.</p>
    <p>Today, I'm in Asheville, North Carolina, equipped with skills in Ruby, Rails, RESTful APIs, TDD, and more. Turing
      taught me how to learn and adapt, and I'm excited to use these skills to support my family and work on meaningful
      projects.</p>
    <p>If you've read this far, thank you! I hope you enjoyed my story.</p>

    <h2>My Work</h2>
    <p>Here are some projects I am working on at the moment:</p>
    <p>An update to the <a href="https://github.com/NicoShanstrom/1000_hours_outside" target="_blank">1000 Hours
      Outside</a> application. My wife was using the other 1000 hours outside challenge to track outdoor time for our
      child because the average American child gets only 4-7 minutes of unstructured outdoor time each day, and that is
      unacceptable. I wanted to track statistics such as total time, daily average, required average per day to reach
      1000 hours, the pace needed to achieve this goal, and detailed session tracking. The project is still in process and needs to be fully tested.</p>
    <p>A web app using the 50/30/20 rule of budgeting called <a href="https://fruga-fe.onrender.com/" target="_blank">Fruga</a>. 
      A user enters their gross income, lists their needs, wants, and savings. The application adds them to a pie chart for visualization. When the user clicks get advice, their data is
      sent to the python microservice if it does not match the 50/30/20 rule, which calls OpenAI api to generate an advice response which then gets sent to the rails backend as advice, 
      all of the users income, needs, wants, savings, and advice is then sent to the front end in a json response. This was a cross functional team, but my technical contributions were on the backend and microservice, 
      which was also a lot of configuratin for a new language and CI/CD setup.
