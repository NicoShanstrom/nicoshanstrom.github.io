    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Nico, a fitness and health professional turned event coordinator and professional photographer turned software developer</p>
    <p>I am a lifelong learner and believe in keeping a 'beginners mind' for there is something to learn from every experience.</p>
    <p>My professional career started in 2010 as a sports performance specialist, supporting athletes of all ages and skill levels to become their best self by increasing physical awareness through speed, power, agility, and sport functional training</p>
    <p>I wanted to increase my reach with my passion of athletic performance to include all populations as everyone should be able to feel at their highest physical level.</p>
    <p>So, I began working with fitness studios and created a private personal training business throughout Miami and Miami Beach.</p>
    <p>In 2012 I decided to persue a Masters Degree of Athletic Training, as it seemed like a good tool to round out my fitness and sports performance expertise with evaluation, therapeutics, testing, rehabilitation, and injury prevention.</p>
    <p>From 2014 to 2017 I worked as an Atlhetic Trainer at Westminster Christian School in Palmetto Bay Florida for all sports from elementary school through high-school.</p>
    <p>Working at a school and having an impact on future generations was very rewarding internally. I would like to achieve this feeling of positively affecting the present and future in future roles.</p>
    <p>In 2016 I travelled to Fiji for 45 days to learn how to be a yoga teacher, as I was practicing regularly and wanted more. Why Fiji? Why NOT Fiji!? Check out the island I was on for training Leleuvia Island.</p>
    <p>Learning the ways of yoga and interacting with the lifestyle and people of Fiji was transforming, one sees the world with new lenses after experiencing how less is more and being grateful for what you have, not thinking about what you do not have grately increases happiness.</p>
    <p>After this eye opening experience, coming back to Miami Beach just did not seem the same, I met my now Wife in 2017 and we went on a cross country trip and ended up in Colorado, because the mountains were calling.</p>
    <p>I continued working as an Athletic Trainer in the Denver Metro area working with professional rugby teams, an EMS company working extreme sport events and college athletics, a physical therapy clinic performing outreach work to local police departments, ergonomic assessments for employees at large corporations, and moonlighting as an athletic trainer for NBA referees at Denver Nuggets home games.</p>
    <p>That work was fun, but it was very seasonal, I began adding more fitness classes back to my workload at OrangeTheory Fitness, which was fun but wow that was intense.</p>
    <p>Enter March 2020, you know how that goes. Can't touch people for a while, there goes all that work. My wife and I began an online yoga and fitness studio for those looking to keep moving, we gained enough monthly members to provide some help. And if anything it help keeps us and our members sane while the world was upside down.</p> 
    <p>My wife, dog, and I left Colorado westbound in my Jeep camping along the way to Northern California and stayed at a family handmade house in the Tahoe forest until November 2021, where we launched our plan to move to Maui.</p>
    <p>We continued westward in the Jeep, adventuring along the way and continuing our online fitness studio on the go whenever we got cell service.</p>
    <p>In any time it is not an easy feat to find a living situation without full work, across the ocean, to a place you have never been before, but we found a fit with a family who was born and raised in Hawaii. That was a great welcome and entrance to Maui for us.</p>
    <p>I started work part time supporting a small business who found a niche during the covid restrictions. Enter, Maui Luxe Picnics.</p>
    <p>People wanted to come to Maui, but with all of the restrictions, restaurants were no fun. This picnic company sets up elegant events on beaufiful beaches, properties, cliffs, forests, hotels, all around the Island of Maui. I coordinated picnics and gave customers the picnic of their dreams.</p>
    <p>Not only was I a coordinator for the customers, was a professional photographer for elopments, anniversaries, engagements, parties, and anything else one could think of. It was fun, in beautiful settings, and I made people memories for life. I also acted as a liason between the vendors, property managers, and hotel managers to make sure everything went smoothly as planned.</p>
    <p>I really had a lot of fun and have a lot of positive memories from this experience. It was seasonal and very weather dependent, so the consistency still was not there. I know deep inside theres more out there for me.</p>
    <p>Well, August 8th, 2023</p>
