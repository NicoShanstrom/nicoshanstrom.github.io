    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Nico, a fitness and health professional turned event coordinator and professional photographer turned software developer</p>
    <p>I am a lifelong learner and believe in keeping a 'beginners mind' for there is something to learn from every experience.</p>
    <p>My professional career started in 2010 as a sports performance specialist, supporting athletes of all ages and skill levels to become their best self by increasing physical awareness through speed, power, agility, and sport functional training</p>
    <p>I wanted to increase my reach with my passion of athletic performance to include all populations as everyone should be able to feel at their highest physical level.</p>
    <p>So, I began working with fitness studios and created a private personal training business throughout Miami and Miami Beach.</p>
    <p>In 2012 I decided to persue a Masters Degree of Athletic Training, as it seemed like a good tool to round out my fitness and sports performance expertise with evaluation, therapeutics, testing, rehabilitation, and injury prevention.</p>
    <p>From 2014 to 2017 I worked as an Atlhetic Trainer at Westminster Christian School in Palmetto Bay Florida for all sports from elementary school through high-school.</p>
    <p>Working at a school and having an impact on future generations was very rewarding internally. I would like to achieve this feeling of positively affecting the present and future in future roles.</p>
    <p>In 2016 I travelled to Fiji for 45 days to learn how to be a yoga teacher, as I was practicing regularly and wanted more. Why Fiji? Why NOT Fiji!? Check out the island I was on for training Leleuvia Island.</p>
    <p>Learning the ways of yoga and interacting with the lifestyle and people of Fiji was transforming, one sees the world with new lenses after experiencing how less is more and being grateful for what you have, not thinking about what you do not have grately increases happiness.</p>
    <p>After this eye opening experience, coming back to Miami Beach just did not seem the same, I met my now Wife in 2017 and we went on a cross country trip and ended up in Colorado, because the mountains were calling.</p>
    <p>I continued working as an Athletic Trainer</p>
