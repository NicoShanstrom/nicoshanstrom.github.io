    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Nico, a fitness and health professional turned event coordinator and professional photographer turned
      software developer.</p>
    <p>I am a lifelong learner and believe in keeping a 'beginner's mind' as there is something to learn from every
      experience.</p>
    <p>My professional career started in 2010 as a sports performance specialist, supporting athletes of all ages and
      skill levels to become their best selves by increasing physical awareness through speed, power, agility, and sport
      functional training.</p>
    <p>I wanted to extend my passion for athletic performance to all populations, believing everyone should be able to
      feel at their highest physical level.</p>
    <p>So, I began working with fitness studios and created a private personal training business throughout Miami and
      Miami Beach.</p>
    <p>In 2012, I decided to pursue a Masters Degree in Athletic Training, as it seemed like a good tool to complement
      my fitness and sports performance expertise with evaluation, therapeutics, testing, rehabilitation, and injury
      prevention.</p>
    <p>From 2014 to 2017, I worked as an Athletic Trainer at Westminster Christian School in Palmetto Bay, Florida,
      covering all sports from elementary through high school.</p>
    <p>Working at a school and impacting future generations was very rewarding. I aim to achieve this feeling of
      positively affecting the present and future in future roles.</p>
    <p>In 2016, I traveled to Fiji for 45 days to learn how to be a yoga teacher. I was practicing regularly and wanted
      more. Why Fiji? Why NOT Fiji!? Check out the island where I trained: Leleuvia Island.</p>
    <p>Learning the ways of yoga and interacting with the lifestyle and people of Fiji was transformative. One sees the
      world with new lenses after experiencing how less is more and being grateful for what you have, not focusing on
      what you don't have, greatly increases happiness.</p>
    <p>After this eye-opening experience, returning to Miami Beach didn't seem the same. I met my now-wife in 2017, and
      we went on a cross-country trip and ended up in Colorado because the mountains were calling.</p>
    <p>I continued working as an Athletic Trainer in the Denver Metro area, working with professional rugby teams, an
      EMS company covering extreme sports events, college athletics, a physical therapy clinic performing outreach work
      to local police departments, ergonomic assessments for employees at large corporations, and moonlighting as an
      athletic trainer for NBA referees at Denver Nuggets home games.</p>
    <p>That work was fun, but it was very seasonal. I began adding more fitness classes back to my workload at
      OrangeTheory Fitness, which was fun but intense.</p>
    <p>Enter March 2020, you know how that goes. Can't touch people for a while, there goes all that work. My wife and I
      started an online yoga and fitness studio for those looking to keep moving. We gained enough monthly members to
      provide some help. If anything, it helped keep us and our members sane while the world was upside down.</p>
    <p>My wife, dog, and I left Colorado westbound in my Jeep, camping along the way to Northern California, and stayed
      at a family handmade house in the Tahoe forest until November 2021, where we launched our plan to move to Maui.
    </p>
    <p>We continued westward in the Jeep, adventuring along the way and continuing our online fitness studio on the go
      whenever we got cell service.</p>
    <p>In any time, it is not easy to find a living situation without full work, across the ocean, to a place you've
      never been before, but we found a fit with a family who was born and raised in Hawaii. That was a great welcome
      and entrance to Maui for us.</p>
    <p>I started work part-time supporting a small business that found a niche during the COVID restrictions. Enter Maui
      Luxe Picnics.</p>
    <p>People wanted to come to Maui, but with all the restrictions, restaurants were no fun. This picnic company sets
      up elegant events on beautiful beaches, properties, cliffs, forests, hotels, all around the Island of Maui. I
      coordinated picnics and gave customers the picnic of their dreams.</p>
    <p>Not only was I a coordinator for the customers, but I was also a professional photographer for elopements,
      anniversaries, engagements, parties, and anything else one could think of. It was fun, in beautiful settings, and
      I made people memories for life. I also acted as a liaison between the vendors, property managers, and hotel
      managers to ensure everything went smoothly as planned.</p>
    <p>I really had a lot of fun and have a lot of positive memories from this experience. It was seasonal and very
      weather-dependent, so the consistency still wasn't there. I know deep inside there's more out there for me.</p>
    <p>Well, August 8th, 2023...</p>
