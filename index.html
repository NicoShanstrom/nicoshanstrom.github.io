    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Nico, a fitness and health professional turned event coordinator and professional photographer turned software developer</p>
    <p>I am a lifelong learner and believe in keeping a 'beginners mind' for there is something to learn from every experience.</p>
    <p>My professional career started in 2010 as a sports performance specialist, supporting athletes of all ages and skill levels to become their best self by increasing physical awareness through speed, power, agility, and sport functional training</p>
    <p>I wanted to increase my reach with my passion of athletic performance to include all populations as everyone should be able to feel at their highest physical level.</p>
    <p>So, I began working with fitness studios and created a private personal training business throughout Miami and Miami Beach.</p>
    <p>In 2014 I decided to persue a Masters Degree of Athletic Training, as it seemed like a good tool to round out my fitness and sports performance expertise with evaluation, therapeutics, testing, rehabilitation, and injury prevention.</p>
